So far the calculations we've been doing have all depended on a *known theoretical probability*. However, most of the time we actually don't know what the real probability is -- if we did, there would be no point in doing statistics! How can random variables help us to analyze a dataset?

## Sampling Distributions
By treating the population parameter as a random variable, we can start making estimates about its probability distribution by analyzing samples.
