## Different Types of Data [(slides)][types]
Data is organized into different categories, which inform which techniques should be used to analyze that data.

> 🞛 qualitative, quantitative  
> 🞛 categorical: nominal, ordinal  
> 🞛 numerical: discrete, continuous

## Python Classes [(slides)][classes]
We will go over how to write and test a class in Python.

> 🞛 `class`, `__init__`, `__repr__`, self, class methods

## Data Structures
As we've seen before, data can be stored in lists and dictionaries. We will learn some _abstract_ structures used to organize data. We will then write Python classes to _implement_ these structures.

### Stacks [(slides)][stacks]
A stack is a data structure with **Last In, First Out** access.

> 🞛 peek, push, pop, top

### Queues [(slides)][queues]
A queue is a data structure with **First In, First Out** access.

> 🞛 peek, enqueue, dequeue, front, back

### Trees [(slides)][trees]
A tree is hierarchical data structure.

> 🞛 parent, child, node, leaf, root, branch
