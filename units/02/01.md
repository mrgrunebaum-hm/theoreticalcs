## Data and its Limitations [(slides)][2.1.1]
Let's define some initial vocabulary for working with data, as well as start talking about what the limitations of data analysis are.

You should be familiar with the following terms:
> data, sample, population, statistics

and the following concepts:
> types of questions to ask about data  
> coverage bias  
> transparency & accountability in statistics

## Reproducibility Crisis [(slides)][2.1.2]
What are some common conceptions of what _science_ is? The reproducibility crisis is one major issue occuring in scientific fields.

Watch [Veritasium's video on Published Research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42QuXLucH3Q).

[538's P-Hacking Project](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/p-hacking/) illustrates how the same data can be used to back up opposing claims.

Keep an eye out for the following terms:
> p-value, p-hacking, reproducibility

We will be revisiting these concepts in-depth later on in the year!
