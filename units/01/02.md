Let's make sure your computer is set up! We'll be going over what everything is in class.

## Overleaf
If you've already read/done this, skip to the **LaTeX** section. 

You will be using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) to write some of your homework submissions. This requires using a markup language called `LaTeX`. I will show a demo in class for how to export the PDFs which you will be submitting.

  1. Create an account on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/register).

## LaTeX
We will be using [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) to write mathematical proofs and solve other types of mathy theoretical computer science problems in this class. LaTeX is a typesetting system used in various academic fields for all kinds of technical writing. Do some [practice](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes)!

## Proof of Irrationality of the Square Root of 5 [(Jamboard)](https://jamboard.google.com/d/16sgZSKZ0xsyG-08zCWGyZJEY2e-TrvD4MPkEgZ98OLs/edit?authuser=0)
We will work through this proof in class on Wednesday, 9/22. We will also have some [homework](template0.tex), which will be posted on Google Classroom 

## Resources
Here are some helpful links for LaTeX:

 > ⊕ [LaTeX Math Wiki](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics): a very helpful document with sections on how to write math in LaTeX
 > ⊕ [LaTeX Stack Exchange](https://tex.stackexchange.com/): a forum where people ask and answer anything and everything LaTeX
 > ⊕ [LaTeX Cheat Sheet](latexsheet.pdf): a very detailed cheat sheet of LaTeX commands and their functions
