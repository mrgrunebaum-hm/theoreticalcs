Let's make sure your computer is set up! We'll be going over what everything is in class.

## Overleaf
You will be using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) to write some of your homework submissions. This requires using a markup language called `LaTeX`. I will show a demo in class for how to export the PDFs which you will be submitting.

  1. Create an account on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/).

## LaTeX
We will be using [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) to write mathematical proofs and solve other types of mathy theoretical computer science problems in this class. LaTeX is a typesetting system used in various academic fields for all kinds of technical writing. Do some [practice](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes)!
