Let's make sure your computer is set up! We'll be going over what everything is in class.

## Visual Studio Code
This is the IDE we'll be using for this class, but if you are comfortable with another, feel free to stick with what you are using.

  1. [Click on this link](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and download the version corresponding to your computer.

## Overleaf
You will be using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) to write some of your homework submissions. This requires using a markup language called `LaTeX`. I will show a demo in class for how to export the PDFs which you will be submitting.

  1. Create an account on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/).

## Scala
We will be using [Scala 2](https://www.scala-lang.org/). Make sure your computer environment is properly set up to compile and run Scala programs.

  1. Install the `Scala (Metals)` extension for VS Code.
  1. Follow [these instructions](https://get-coursier.io/docs/cli-installation) for installing Coursier.
  1. Run `cs install cs` in your terminal.
  1. Run `cs setup` in your terminal.
  1. Check your installation by running `scala` in your terminal. A `scala` shell should pop up. You can exit by typing `:quit`.

## Homebrew (optional, for Mac users)
Homebrew is a useful software package manager for Apple machines â€“ if you run into any trouble with the above steps for installing Coursier and running Scala, you may wish to try a 'brew install'. 

  1. Download Homebrew by following the steps at this [link](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation). 
  2. Once finished, follow the instructions for '[mac OS - brew based installation](https://get-coursier.io/docs/cli-installation#macos-brew-based-installation)' of Coursier. 

## Organization
On your desktop (or preferred folder), create a new folder titled `TheoreticalCS`. This is where you'll keep all your files for this course.
