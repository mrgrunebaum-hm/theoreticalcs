# Scala
The Scala programming language combines object-oriented and functional programming in one concise, high-level language. It has a very expressive syntax, and is familiar to both Java and Python.

## Worksheets
Most of our classwork will not be complete projects, but rather snippets of code that showcase the concepts that we are learning. A *Scala worksheet* is a great environment to work in!

You can define a Scala worksheet file by giving it the `.worksheet.sc` extension.

## Basics
Complete the attached [worksheet]({{site.baseurl}}/units/01/warmup.worksheet.sc). You should familiarize yourself with how Scala handles the following concepts.

> ⊕ def, val, var, types  
> ⊕ conditionals  
> ⊕ while / for loops  
> ⊕ functions
