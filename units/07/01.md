## Statistical Inference
So far we've learned many ways to *describe* a dataset, but our conclusions are valid only for the *samples* that we look at. How can we start making statements about the *population*, so that we can make informed decisions and predictions?

The basis of **statistical inference** lies in analyzing sampling distributions.

## Confidence Intervals
A confidence interval is an interval estimate that we believe with some degree of confidence to contain the population parameter.
