We've spent a lot of time now on how data can be obtained and stored, as well as how to evaluate the quality of a dataset. Once we are confident in a dataset, we can start using statistics to describe it.

## Introduction [(slides)][intro]
We will discuss the first step of descriptive statistics: obtaining frequencies. We will learn some vocabulary on how to visualize and discuss data distributions. 

> ⊕ summary statistics  
> ⊕ limitations (sample vs population)  
> ⊕ frequency, mean, mode  
> ⊕ categorical bar chart (Pareto)  
> ⊕ distribution, histogram, normal, distribution  
> ⊕ uni/bimodal, shape, skew, symmetric, tail  

## Measuring Center and Variability [(slides)][center]
Two other common measures of a dataset's distributions are center and variability.

> ⊕ mean, median, mode  
> ⊕ range, standard deviation, z-score  
> ⊕ normal distribution, bell curve  
> ⊕ percentile, quartile, interquartile range,  
> ⊕ box plot, violin plot
