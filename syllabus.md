# Assignments
Homework is meant for you to learn and practice, and should be a space where you make mistakes (because you are learning new material)! It's absolutely okay for you to be stuck on the homework. Class time is meant to help you work through these obstacles! Students will sometimes be asked to present their solutions in front of the class, and will have the opportunity to field questions and suggestions from classmates. Thus, it is crucial that you come to class prepared.

# Participation
Since so much of this course involves groupwork and collaborating with others to learn new material, it is important that each student actively participates. Participation can mean showing up to class on time, asking questions in class, answering other students' questions, coming to office hours, working with classmates, contributing to a class discussion, or many other things. 

Part of my job is to help you learn and hone your learning styles – how you best engage with our material in _Theoretical_ and how you feel most confident and comfortable participating in the classroom. This is something we will discuss this year both as a class and on an individual basis.

# Discussions
We will regularly discuss and analyze topical readings and other relevant media alongside the technical and mathematical course material. Each reading will include a written response, as well as participation in an in-class discussion. These are graded on a completion basis.

# Assessments
Quizzes will only ever cover what you have done for homework, and what we have done together in class.

Labs assess whether you can take everything you've learned so far and put it together, often in the format of a longer programming assignment (or a written proof) and a corresponding write-up, usually comprised of a couple short answer questions. Labs will be given at the end of each unit. Details will be provided when these assessments are given.

### Retakes and Revisions
We will often have quiz retakes as a class, but individual retakes are also an option. On any given quiz, only your most recent attempt will count toward your grade.

Lab revisions are handled on a case-by-case basis.

### Lab Submissions
Labs will always be submitted on Google Classroom as Scala files. Most of your labs will be saved as Scala Worksheets (file extension ```.worksheet.sc```). 

For all labs, we will follow the naming convention ```yourLastnameLab1.worksheet.sc``` unless you are specifically told otherwise. Of course, replace 'yourLastname' with your actual last name and replace 'Lab1' with whichever number lab it is.

# Academic Honesty
Any submitted work by a student should be their own, unless students are collaborating on a group assignment, in which case the work submitted should be a reflection of equal effort of all students involved. Collaboration is always encouraged – feel free to talk with other students and work through material! However, any work turned in must be your own and students must always **cite** who they worked with on final submissions of assignments.

If you are ever considering cheating on an assignment, please reach out to me immediately and let me know the assignment will be late and that you need extra help. **I will make sure that you receive the help and support you need and that your standing in the class is not adversely impacted.** 

Serious forms of cheating will result in a **failing grade** on that particular assignment and the student’s grade dean and advisor will be notified for the first offense. Forms of cheating include but are not limited to: similar / identical writing or code submitted, solutions submitted that are not a student’s own work, submission of fabricated or otherwise unreliable data.

**I would rather you submit something late than something academically dishonest.** If you are ever unsure, reach out to me! I want to help you succeed in this class.

# Semester Grade
If you complete all of the assigned work for this class, you will earn an excellent grade.
  - Summative Assessments (labs/project, quizzes, homework): 80%
  - Discussions (both written and in-class components): 20%
